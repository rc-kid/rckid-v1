- ACKed packets does not seem to work yet

- check ACK payload being delivered

- there's an issue with SPI, the breadboard is pretty unstable affair. Other than that seems to work. Antenna is necessary. I think the rubber duckie can be stripped and added in the case easily. The connector can be semi-exposed to allow for longer range antennas for the walkie-talkie, if ever necessary. Range must be properly tested.
